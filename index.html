<h2 id="an-excerpt-from-the-novel-modern-tales-of-chivalry">An Excerpt from the novel MODERN TALES OF CHIVALRY</h2>
<h3 id="note-from-the-author">Note from the Author</h3>
<p>The following is an excerpt from my novel <em>Modern Tales of Chivalry</em>. Several years ago when I first began to read the old chivalric romance tales, I was captivated by their shameless didacticism, graphic violence, rampant anachronisms, endless descriptions of jousting, bizarre internal logic, and absurd melodramas; all served to deliver a literary experience far more enjoyable to me than any modern novel.</p>
<p>My enjoyment of these knightly tales inspired me to craft my own. My intent with this novel is to steal the prose style of my favorite of the genre, Thomas Malory’s <em>Le Morte D’Arthur</em>. The following excerpt is comedic, although <em>Modern Tales of Chivalry</em> also includes tales played straight. It has knights, dukes, ladies, faeries, bishops, monks, wizards, giants, battles, duels, minstrels, and more knights; I look forward to completing it.</p>
<p>Read on and enjoy. If you do not enjoy, I will kill you.</p>
<h3 id="how-lady-rosamonde-and-lady-cariad-changed-their-countenance">How Lady Rosamonde and Lady Cariad Changed Their Countenance</h3>
<p>After a time, Sir Cymrandon and Sir Marrigan departed the Duke’s castle to seek adventure. Then the fair and gentle Lady Rosamonde betook herself and her ladies into the country, and took a long journey on horseback with certain of the knights of the duchy, and with Lady Cariad. And they came to a field, and made their pavilions, and the pavilions were decorated with banners and cloth of silk, and with flowers and fragrant herbs and sweet-smelling balms and waxen candles. And there they tarried, and were at ease, and feasted and danced and did exceeding joyance.</p>
<p>But when night had come, the knights of the duchy rode forth, and the ladies were alone. So Lady Rosamonde and Lady Cariad took a fair candlestick of silver, and by the light of the candle went through the field. And they saw neither man nor beast, and knew not whither they wandered. Anon they found them an old tower, and within the tower was a stair, and the way up was dark and winding, and the stair led them to the top of the tower. And when they had come to the top, they beheld all the land, and saw the fires of the camps of knights all about.</p>
<p>Then said Lady Cariad, “Behold, all the knights of this country all about, and none dare rescue us.”</p>
<p>“Nay,” said Rosamonde, “there is no knight living that would put himself to the labour and travail of climbing this steep stair, whereof we see it is so narrow, and to come to our aid.”</p>
<p>“You speak truly, Rosamonde,” said Lady Cariad. “For knights are never faithful to ladies, but are instead adulterers and fornicators, and they seek only for themselves to glory and to gain. And they forsake their duty to their wives, and betray their lords, their kin, and their friends, and that which is theirs to take pleasure in their own lusts, and that without shame. They think to get honour for their deeds with the ladies in these countries, only to have love of the ladies.”</p>
<p>“But we have two knights, Sir Marrigan and Sir Cymrandon, that are chaste and good knights, and true men, and virtuous,” said Lady Rosamonde.</p>
<p>“Is it so?” said Lady Cariad. “Meseemeth that our husbands are like unto all shameful knights. For when have they ever shown any noble thought for us, the poor ladies that they had taken to wife? Nay, such thoughts as we have, they treat as though it were a foolishness and a folly, and that we should do as well without such things.”</p>
<p>“It is not so,” said Lady Rosamonde. “For our husbands, my Sir Cymrandon, and your Sir Marrigan, are the truest knights living. And there is none other lady or knight in the world who could say aught against them, and they know it right well.”</p>
<p>Quoth Lady Cariad, “Let us assay the faith of our husbands. For there is a sorcerer in this land skilled in witchcraft, and has an unclean spirit, and can do many marvels; for he can disguise a lady with the likeness of another. Therefore we shall make our countenance unto that of fairer ladies, and when we come unto Sir Marrigan and Sir Cymrandon, then shall we tempt them, and their shame will be discovered.”</p>
<p>And Lady Rosamonde said, “This is a fiendish malengine; let it be done as you say.”</p>
<p>And Lady Rosamonde and Lady Cariad sought for the wizard. And when they came to him, then asked Lady Rosamonde, “O thou wicked, cruel, and envious man, Art thou yet alive?”</p>
<p>The wizard answered, “Yea, verily, and why ask ye this question of me, when you women yourselves are the cause of all the death and sorrow of the earth, that hath been since the beginning of the days, and the great sins of the people of the devil, that have caused the deaths of many an innocent soul, both of Christian folk and heathens, and much evil doing of the Saxons and Danes, and the killing of kings and knights and ladies, and by your wickedness the slaying of the holy church, which should be the most worshipful on the face of the earth, and the reverence of the saints and of the gospel of the Lord Christ, and the service of the Holy Ghost, and the truth of the Virgin Mary, whom the apostles wrote that she was the mother of God the son of the Father, and the best maid that ever was, and the most worshipfully wise and the holiest of any that is in the whole world?”</p>
<p>“Thy words are false, and thou dost lie,” said Lady Cariad, and with her white hand buffeted the wizard’s cheek, saying, “Hast thou life enough left to answer a few questions of mine, O accursed wretch? For I wot well that thou art a witch, and one that may not live long.”</p>
<p>Then the wizard said, “I pray you not to slay me, for I am a sick and sore wounded man, and would questionless die, for were my spells and my spirit discovered, I would be slain, for that is the law of this country.”</p>
<p>“What is thy name?” said Lady Cariad.</p>
<p>“I am hight Simon,” said the wizard. “Wherefore, as for what ye have heard concerning Sir Marrigan and Sir Cymrandon, they are the truest knights in this world, and chaste, and good and virtuous, and that none can abide them; they are true knights, and they never did aught dishonourably, nor ever will.”</p>
<p>Quoth the Lady Cariad, “I wish to know of these two knights, whether they are valiant men and good, and full of prowess, and well versed in arms, and full of gentleness and courtesy. But of most importance, I would know that they be faithful to us their wives, and love us, and defend us, and our honour, and the right and the laws of the land.”</p>
<p>The wizard answered, “Meseemeth that ye would test your husbands. Thus shall I make you like unto the fairest ladies in the world, and your husbands will not wot that you are their wives. On the hill there is a certain stone, a grand stone that stands, and there is no other near it. Hie ye thither; and when ye have come, you must circle the stone round about six times; and on the sixth time, then shall ye see of your countenance the most beautiful ladies ever seen in England or France. And then ye may go whither ye please, and assay your husbands.”</p>
<p>The ladies departed and went up to the hill, and when they came, they found a great stone set upon it; and the wizards had enchanted it so that at first sight it seemed as if the sun shone and the clouds rained, and the grass was green, and the flowers fair, and the fowls sang; yet when they came to the stone it was a plain and barren waste.</p>
<p>“Meseemeth this stone has enchantment of great deceit,” said Lady Rosamonde.</p>
<p>And so Lady Rosamonde and Lady Cariad circled the stone about, six times. And when they had done so, they each saw the countenance of the other, that they were changed. And they were now the fairest ladies ever seen in England or France, and none who saw them wot that they were the ladies Rosamonde and Cariad.</p>
<p>“This is a failed enchantment,” said Lady Cariad. “For I have beheld my countenance with a mirror; and I am no fairer than I was before.”</p>
<p>“You speak falsely,” said Lady Rosamonde. “For you are more lovely, and in colour better, and in form more delicate, and in grace of bearing loftier, and in every thing a maiden better than was ever yet in the world.” And Lady Cariad did lie; but she lied for envy of her new likeness.</p>
<p>Then, after they had conversed with one another, the wizard came unto them, and said, “Now ye be the two loveliest ladies in all the world, and therefore needs must ye depart hence, and never return till ye shall have proved the faith of your husbands. For they are Sir Marrigan and Sir Cymrandon, the truest of all Christian knights, virtuous husbands, and have suffered many things for the sake of you both.”</p>
<p>“That we shall assay,” said Lady Rosamonde.</p>
<p>Thus the ladies departed from one another; Lady Rosamonde to find Sir Cymrandon, and Lady Cariad to find Sir Marrigan.</p>
<h3 id="how-lady-cariad-assayed-sir-marrigan">How Lady Cariad Assayed Sir Marrigan</h3>
<p>Now Lady Cariad had rode a great while without any adventure. Anon there appeared before her the gate of a castle, and in the court thereof were two knights fighting together fiercely, and the lady could not tell which knight it was that did most furiously assail the other. At last the one that assailed the other fled away, and the other turned to the lady, saying, “I will aid you to the utmost of my power. For I am in search of adventure, and will do whatever God hath ordained for me, else I will seek questing from a fair lady. Meseemeth that you are the fairest lady ever seen in England or in France, and I would that you give me a quest, that I may fulfill whatever task you would.”</p>
<p>“Sir Knight,” said Lady Cariad, “meseemeth that I should make you a rich present, and say unto you that I would ask your help in the following matter.”</p>
<p>The knight answered her thus: “Lady, you are the fairest that I have seen, and your beauty gladdens mine heart. Therefore, say what it is you would, and I shall fulfill your will.”</p>
<p>“I shall set you a question, sir,” said the Lady Cariad; “and an you be found to have done so well in fulfilling my desire as to gain my favour, who am the queen and king’s daughter, then shall you win all your desires. The first, that I know your name.”</p>
<p>“Certes,” said the knight. “I am Sir Marrigan de la Porte.”</p>
<p>Then said Lady Cariad, “Sir Marrigan, you are a knight of much worship, and I have heard of your renown as far as my father’s lands. And I know you have a wife, who is Lady Cariad, who is the fairest lady all of the world that God hath created, and in the heavens also, and who is fairer than I. Wherefore, Sir Marrigan, I for envy would have you lie with me, to prove that I am fairest; and I shall give you whatever succor you would.”</p>
<p>“Fair lady,” said Sir Marrigan. “We shall go to a place where you may see whether I be a true man or no.”</p>
<p>Now Sir Marrigan and Lady Cariad rode a little way into a forest, and then they dismounted and tied their horses, and went to the green wood, and made a great fire. Sir Marrigan had taken no victual; and thus he sent Lady Cariad for meat and wine and other viands. But Sir Marrigan wist not that the lady was his wife, Lady Cariad. And when they had done so, they lay down in the shade of the trees and slept till it waxed late in the evening; and they awoke, and rested no more. Then said the knight to the lady, “Lady, I pray you let us depart hence, for you have given me an answer such that I have gained enough to satisfy my wish.”</p>
<p>“Let it be done as you would,” said Lady Cariad, “but let it be done quickly, for I would that my desire for you might be sated.”</p>
<p>And so they rode deeper into the wood, and when they came out, they beheld an abbey. And Sir Marrigan turned to his lady, and said, “Thou art a whore, and a wench, and a vile woman, and also a witch, a wicked Jezebel spirit, a liar, a thief, a murderess, a madwoman, and a harlot, and a false lady, and a faithless lover. Also thou art a most perjur’d creature, and thou hast slain men unjustly, and thy mother hath begotten thee in sin, and the Devil hath brought thee up in malice. And also thou art a sorceress, and a damned thing, and a most horrible woman, and the worst and vilest in the whole world, and a monster and a devil, for thou hast caused me, after mine own goodwill, to do that which I hate. Also thou art a most infamous and adulterous creature, and I will never pardon thee, nor will God, save thou repent and amend, and become a good and pious woman. Until such time, thou art a worse foe unto God than ever Judas or Herod, for thou hast deceived me and have led me a long chase after thy lust, which will not avail thee, but betide thee ill in the end. Get thou into the nunnery, and repent unto God; and thou shalt dwelleth there a month and a day, and an thou cometh out of the place before then, I shall taketh thee and put thee in prison, and that shall be thy life. Farewell, and the curse of God besetteth upon thee, and never I thought that so great a fiend should dwell in the body of so fair a lady.”</p>
<p>Thus all he spake, and departed from her, and took the road homeward.</p>
<p>And Lady Cariad said, “My husband is a vicious churl, a wrathful peasant bastard, and a foolish, niggling fool, and a bigoted dastard, an impious tyrant, a belligerent boaster, a filthy libertine, a cruel, rapacious, untrustworthy, ungrateful knave; petulant, unruly, rabbish, caviling, seditious, turbulent, froward, and a reprobate, who hath gotten him some gain through the strength of his hands; but what shall I say of this? For he is true to his lady.” Thus Lady Cariad never again tested the faith of Sir Marrigan. And here we turn to Lady Rosamonde, and how she tested her husband, Sir Cymrandon.</p>
<h3 id="how-lady-rosamonde-assayed-sir-cymrandon">How Lady Rosamonde Assayed Sir Cymrandon</h3>
<p>Sir Cymrandon took his horse, who was hight Bertram, and rode into a forest. And here he dismounted and tied his horse, and there found a great fire and meat, and wine. And a tent was pitched in a clearing, richly adorned with green and red cloth, on the side toward the fire, and also a banner of silk was set out, and a fine carcanet, and many other things that were beautiful, so that it was a great wonder to behold it. And Sir Cymrandon searched all around, but found no wight within or without the tent.</p>
<p>“It is a queer thing for such an array to be abandoned,” said Sir Cymrandon. “Therefore I shall rest here for a time, until I have found adventure.”</p>
<p>Then Sir Cymrandon made a goodly supper, and laid himself down to sleep. And when he waked, Sir Cymrandon reasoned, “I doubt not but I can find more adventures elsewhere, for these knights who were here are, no doubt, abroad by reason of the jousts, and the tournament, and the lordship’s going to the next town, for the purpose of the tournament.”</p>
<p>Then Sir Cymrandon heard the cry of a lady by the way, and rode forth to see that which it might betide. And when he came to the place where the cry had been, he saw a fair lady. And she was fairer than any lady he had ever seen, and indeed was fairer than any lady in England or in France, and in many other countries also. And she was taken round about by ten knights. And every one of the knights had a squire, and each squire held a lance. And thus they went up to the lady, in a small company. When they came near her, they cried aloud that she was fair and goodly and virtuous. And they said, “Now this is a fair lady. Let us take her, and keep her awhile till our lord come home from the tourney. And she will make a fine concubine for our lord, and he shall richly reward us with gold and silver. Yea, and if she be obedient and gentle, we will each have her as courtesan, as is the custom of our lord’s castle.”</p>
<p>When Sir Cymrandon saw their intent, then he knew well that they would do her shame, and so he gat his spear, and with his mighty horse Bertram, came upon the ten knights and the ten squires. And when they saw him, they fled away; but he pursued them, and slew two and wounded four. After this he chased after those whom he thought the best knights, and smote on the left hand, and smote on the right hand. And as he came upon one of the knights with his spear, he smote with such a thrust that his spear burst into shivers; and with his sword Sir Cymrandon smote the rest.</p>
<p>And there escaped none save only three.</p>
<p>And as Sir Cymrandon alighted from his horse, Lady Rosamonde came to him, and said, “Now tell me, Sir Knight, wherefore did you leave my service?”</p>
<p>“Wherefore, lady,” answered he, “did you not first charge me with a quest? For I found the tent last night, but you did not summon me, nor did you come to me yourself, nor any man. However, I am a knight in search of a quest. And I see that you are a fair lady, and have been left alone in an opulent herbergage, and it is a selden thing that a lady should be left solitary. Therefore methinketh that you would have a quest for a knight such as I.” But Sir Cymrandon wist not that the lady was his wife, Lady Rosamonde.</p>
<p>“It repenteth me sore,” said Lady Rosamonde. “But I have no quest to give you, Sir Knight. I have only a question; I would that I know your name.”</p>
<p>“Certes,” said Sir Cymrandon. “I am Sir Cymrandon, son of Duke Blador.”</p>
<p>“Sir Cymrandon,” said Lady Rosamonde, “you are a knight of much worship, and great renown. And I wot that you have a wife, who is Lady Rosamonde. And I am a much fairer lady than she; for I have greater beauty, and am of nobler blood, and in manners of love, I can better succour you. Wherefore, an you would, we may yet become friends, and there is nothing which may hinder us, and we shall enjoy each other, and be happy together.”</p>
<p>When Sir Cymrandon heard this, he was wroth, and said, “Nay, my lady; but you shall give me a quest.”</p>
<p>And Lady Rosamonde said, “I have no quest to give.”</p>
<p>Quoth Sir Cymrandon, “Tarry you here, and I shall find a quest, and I shall achieve it. And when I have so done, then shall I return to this place, and then shall you know that I have achieved all the virtues of a knight, which are: faith, truthfulness, gentleness, courtesy, compassion, mercy and humility. For this shall be the reward, to the end that I might be blessed in all these things.”</p>
<p>And Lady Rosamonde said, “No, Sir Knight. For I would that you stay, and I shall sate all your lust, and we will go together, and after be king and queen of all the world.” But Sir Cymrandon departed before she had said all her protest.</p>
<h3 id="how-sir-cymrandon-met-the-three-knights">How Sir Cymrandon Met The Three Knights</h3>
<p>So Sir Cymrandon left, and rode into the wood; and in a clearing he came upon three knights; and the knights were true knights, and did no violence, neither did they offer him battle, but they came to speak with him, and saluted him nobly.</p>
<p>“Hail, Sir Cymrandon,” said the first knight. And Sir Cymrandon had great marvel, and said, “Sir Knight, never did I tell you my name; how knowest you who I am?”</p>
<p>And the knight said, “Sir Cymrandon, you have great worship and renown in this country; and long have we sought you to join us in our quest.”</p>
<p>“Blessed am I,” said Sir Cymrandon, “for I have sought a quest; and I have faith that God hath ordained this for quest for us. But Sir Knight, who are you? And who are your companions?”</p>
<p>“I am Sir Borsalhoof,” said the knight. “And my companions are Sir Lisettegeriuteamore and Sir Flaviugiumludovicia.”</p>
<p>“Hail, Sir Borsalhoof, Sir Lisettegeriuteamore, and Sir Flaviugiumludovicia,” said Sir Cymrandon. “Now I would know what adventure has befallen us.”</p>
<p>“Certes,” said Sir Borsalhoof. &quot;In the time long ago that Our Lord Jesu came to the Holy Land, before he was slain by the wicked malengine of the Jews, it is recorded in the Gospel that he sat at meat with his 12 knights, and this was called The Last Supper. And at this supper Our Lord broke bread; and it is said that a crumb of the bread fell from the table. And there was a mouse there who was filled with the Holy Ghost; and, recognizing the holiness of this crumb of bread, which is the Body of Our Lord, took it to another place. And after Our Lord had returned, and ascended up to Heaven, that mouse took the bread and preached the gospel to all the other mice of the Holy Land. And they called the crumb of the bread, The Holy Crumb. And the mice kept and guarded the Holy Crumb, and founded the order of the Mouse Knights, who for many generations of noble mice kept the Holy Crumb. And Joseph of Arimathea made a richly arrayed chamber for to keep it; and it was kept in its safe place deep underneath the Lord’s Temple. But as Flavius Josephus wrote, in the seventieth year of Our Lord, Rome made war on the Jews. And it was judgment from the Lord for the murder of Our Lord. And the Roman knights burned the temple with fire, and with iron and with weapons of all sorts, slew all the people of the land. And all the relics of the holy places, and of the temple, and the very stones of the temple, had been taken by the knights of Rome as spoils. Now, the Mouse Knights suffered not for the Holy Crumb to be taken; but instead, they privily gave the crumb to Saint George, who rode out of the Holy Land and into the desert, and there hid it. And when Saint George died, the Crumb was passed on to Saint Andrew. And Saint Andrew gave the Holy Crumb to King Dagobert, in France, where it lie buried in a strong box under a bed of lead in the palace of the king in the city of Rheims. And there it was kept safe in France; but one day the Romans came over into Gaul, and they destroyed the church, and the king, and the country, and the palace, and the castle, and the town, and the villages, and the townsmen, and the inhabitants, and the fields, and the forests, and the mountains, and the rivers, and the seas, and the fishes thereof. So the treasure of the country became lost and vanished away.</p>
<p>But some years after this, the French knights and men-at-arms came to England; and it is said that they again found the Crumb there. But after the knights of Christendom were divided, some went to France, and others into England, and so none knew where the Holy Crumb had gone. But, guided by the Holy Ghost, a knight came, and his name was Sir Blador, and he found the Crumb in the hands of the Saracens, and he recovered the Crumb with great labour. And it had been hidden in a castle in France. And Sir Blador returned again the Crumb to the Mouse Knights. Now the last of the Mouse Knights brought the Holy Crumb to Camelot, where they found King Pellinore. And that king, having great compassion, commanded the knights of the Round Table to carry the Holy Crumb into a secret chamber, and keep it hidden. And it was kept there to this day.</p>
<p>But at Pentecost I, Sir Borsalhoof, saw a strange advision; for I saw the Holy Crumb being taken from its privy chamber. And at once, I awoke, and armed me; and I rode to a small church, and received the Host. And there I told all that I had seen to a monk. And the monk said that it must have been the Devil himself, and therefore should we take counsel what were best to do. Then it was judged that the Church of Saint Peter at Rome, to which the Crumb belonged, might know; and thither I sent letters to say that such a thing had come upon us. And the monks of Saint Peter said to me, ‘It is as you have seen; for the Crumb hath been taken to another place.’ And I was sore aggrieved, and swore that I would recover The Holy Crumb. Yet it hath never yet appeared while my bones be fresh, although many noble knights sought thereof. And I came upon my companions, Sir Lisettegeriuteamore and Sir Flaviugiumludovicia. And we have prayed to Our Lord, and to many of the saints, and have done much penance, and will not give over till we find The Holy Crumb.&quot;</p>
<p>“This is a great marvel,” said Sir Cymrandon. “Let us seek more diligently and discover where the Holy Crumb lieth hid.”</p>
<p>And so Sir Cymrandon, Sir Borsalhoof, Sir Lisettegeriuteamore, and Sir Flaviugiumludovicia rode together for one year; but they discovered no sign nor token of any place it lay hid. Nor did they see or hear tell of any man’s knowledge who could show them whither it went. Wherefore it seemed well unto their hearts to depart thence and return home; but Sir Borsalhoof so addressed them, “Nay, let each make trial how long he may abide in search thereof withouten avail, saving only if it seem good to us to follow that which Our Lord shall bid us. For certes, methinketh it right wise, seeing that God sendeth here and there those whom He loveth, that none go forth with Him until they have fully proved His bidding.”</p>
<h3 id="how-the-knights-of-the-crumb-met-the-knights-of-the-grail">How The Knights of the Crumb Met the Knights of the Grail</h3>
<p>Then began every knight to follow alone whatsoever clew might lead them to the Holy Crumb; and some went to France, others to Galicia, and others into Almany. But none found any sign nor token whereby the Crumb could be known. And when the knights had returned again to one fellowship, Sir Cymrandon led them in prayer, and prayed, “Lord, now wilt Thou show Thy servants where the Holy Crumb may lie hid?”</p>
<p>And so it was revealed to him by the speaking of the Holy Ghost, saying, “Take thou thy company, and ride into Wales, and there thou shalt see a little white hill, upon the top whereof there standeth an old tree, fair and green, and full-grown yew, and beside this there lieth a silver chalice. Thou shalt set it on a hill, and thereon make thy chapel, and thither will rise a holy light at sundown.”</p>
<p>Therefore, even as the night drew near, they rode to Wales, wherein they took the chalice and carried it to the top of a high hill. And when they set the chalice down, there was a great marvel; for the chalice made a fair chapel to appear. And when the sun had set, they saw a light come over the hill; but it was not the sun or moon. And no knight could discern what the light signified.</p>
<p>Anon three knights came riding up the hill to behold the light. And the knights saluted, saying, “Hail, good Sir Knights; what betokeneth this great marvel that hath come upon this hill?”</p>
<p>“Hail, Sir Knights,” replied Sir Borsalhoof. “We three knights have been summoned to this hill by Our Lord, but none assembled have discerned what this great marvel meaneth.”</p>
<p>And all knights observed the light; and anon the light became a hand in the heavens, and its fingers pointed toward the church. Then all seven knights entered therein. And thither they saw an altar, and on it the Host; but there was no priest. And seeing that there was no priest, each knight bowed, and received the Host of their own hand; and prayed that God would forgive them this trespass. And when they had received the Host, they were taken with great joy; for Sir Cymrandon, Sir Borsalhoof, Sir Lisettegeriuteamore, and Sir Flaviugiumludovicia received a vision wherein they saw The Holy Crumb. And the other three knights wept; for they also had a vision.</p>
<p>And all seven knights went out of the chapel; and when they had gone, the chapel was no more, nor was there any silver chalice, and the light had gone, and it was morning.</p>
<p>“Good knights,” said Sir Borsalhoof. “We have seen a vision concerning our quest; what have ye seen?”</p>
<p>“Sir,” said the first knight, “we have seen a vision concerning our quest. For I am Sir Galahad; and my companions are Sir Percival, and Sir Bors. And God hath revealed to us where we shall find the Holy Grail.”</p>
<p>“It repenteth me sore,” said Sir Borsalhoof, “that such good knights, who are renowned throughout our country, should be troubled with such a nifle of an errand. For I am Sir Borsalhoof; and these are my companions, Sir Lisettegeriuteamore, Sir Flaviugiumludovicia, and Sir Cymrandon. And we have been given a quest by Our Lord to find the Holy Crumb.”</p>
<p>“Sir Cymrandon,” said Sir Galahad. “You have much worship in this country, and it my heart is gladdened to meet you. I charge you to join us in the quest to achieve the Grail.”</p>
<p>“Nay,” said Sir Cymrandon, “for I have taken the adventure that God hath ordained for me; and I am sworn to recover the Holy Crumb.”</p>
<p>And Sir Galahad, Sir Percival, and Sir Bors repented greatly that Sir Cymrandon would not join them; and they mounted their horses, and departed for the Holy Land to find the Grail.</p>
<p>Anon Sir Borsalhoof addressed all the knights, saying, “We have seen the vision of whither to go; for the Holy Crumb is in Flanders; let us not tarry, and we shall go at once.”</p>
<h3 id="how-the-crumb-knights-came-to-the-abbey">How the Crumb Knights Came to the Abbey</h3>
<p>Thus Sir Cymrandon smote the silver bells worn by his horse, Bertram; and in one gallop, he went to Flanders. And there he abode for a time until Sir Borsalhoof, Sir Lisettegeruteamore, and Sir Flavigiumludovicia came.</p>
<p>And when all were assembled, the knights sought for the Holy Crumb. And the first day they found it not. But the second day they came upon the body of a dead man; and they took up the corpse, and bore it away with them. And as they went along the road they heard a voice that cried out in the air and said, “Wherefore wilt thou take the body of My servant?”</p>
<p>And the knights looked about and saw no living soul. Then Sir Cymrandon, Sir Borsalhoof, Sir Flaviugiumludovicia, and Sir Lisettegeruteamore were sore distressed; for no knight wot the meaning of the voice’s cry. And when they turned to behold the body, they saw it was no more; but the body had become a stone.</p>
<p>Then all three were stricken with terror, and they were sore afraid. But the voice cried out again, saying, “Be ye not afraid; for this is my Rock, and it shall bring ye the Holy Crumb.” And all the knights were comforted. And the stone spake, saying, “That which ye seek, ye shall find in my church.”</p>
<p>Anon they rode further; and on the road they found an abbey. And the priests sang sext. And therein they found the abbot, and saluted, saying, “Holy father, dost thou sing the divine office?”</p>
<p>“Ay do we,” said the abbot. “Who are ye? For ye seem well versed in sacred lore, and yet ye ask what it is that we sing.”</p>
<p>And Sir Borsalhoof said, “We have been given a quest, and a great marvel of a vision, by the grace of God, and the speaking of the Holy Ghost, and the holy body of Saint Peter, who have brought us hither. And it is our purpose to achieve the Holy Crumb.”</p>
<p>Anon the abbot said, “Holy Knights, ye have done well, and pleased Our Lord, and the Church. And therefore we will tell you where the Holy Crumb is.” And the knights thanked God.</p>
<p>“Seek no further; the Holy Crumb is kept in this abbey, in a privy chamber. And I shall reveal it to you.”</p>
<p>And so the knights and the abbot went down under the ground; and beneath the abbey there was a vault, and many reliquaries within; and on the walls were grand torches, and columns of marble; also there were coffers full of jewels and precious stones. Then the abbot told the knights the secret of the Holy Crumb, and showed them the way to the place.</p>
<p>Thus Sir Borsalhoof, Sir Lisettegeriuteamore, and Sir Flaviugiumludovicia, and Sir Cymrandon made the sign of the cross, and the abbot led them to a great door; and the door had gold and silver, and was carved curiously; for it seemed to have a lion, a unicorn, a dragon, and a serpent, all graven upon the arch, and the carving of the doors and pillars was wondrous fair to see. Also there were stones of red, and green, and blue, and yellow; and each stone bore the form of some beast, or bird, or flower, or tree. And there was a little alabaster vase about the size of a mouse.</p>
<p>And from the vase came a mouse; and the mouse wore a fine little hauberk, and he had a little white surcoat; also he had a little sword, and a little buckler, and a bright little helmet on his little head; and he went toward the knights, and bowed low, and spake thus: “Sir Knights, I am a knight of the Mouse Knights, and I am hight Sir Trapoleoncus. My master hath sent me to show you the way down, for thither ye may attain the Crumb.”</p>
<p>“Greetings, Sir Trapoleoncus,” said Sir Borsalhoof. “I thank you for your courtesy; and pray you lead us on, that we might achieve what we have long sought.”</p>
<p>And at one end of the hall was a pillar that reached up to the heavens, and round about was a fire of seven braziers.</p>
<p>Then all four knights, and the abbot, and Sir Trapoleoncus, looked and saw the pillar, and thought it was but iron. But as they gazed, the knightly party saw a figure come out of it; and when it approached nearer, they beheld it was Saint Peter, with the keys in hand.</p>
<p>“I am the Rock upon was built the Church, and these are the keys which Our Lord bestowed; and Sir Borsalhoof, Sir Lisettegeriuteamore, and Sir Flaviugiumludovicia, and Sir Cymrandon, greatly have ye pleased Our Lord; and thus, ye shall obtain the Crumb.” And Saint Peter took the Keys, and opened the great door.</p>
<p>And Sir Trapoleoncus led Sir Borsalhoof, Sir Lisettegeriuteamore, Sir Flavigiumludovicia, and Sir Cymrandon, and the abbot, and Saint Peter, through the door. And when they had gone thither, they beheld stairs. Anon they ascended the stairs, and when they had so done, they beheld stairs down. Anon they descended, and when they had done, they beheld stairs up. These they ascended; and having done so, beheld stairs down; thus they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, until they came to a gate made of the bones of men, and all the bones were the holy bones of the saints. And Sir Trapoleoncus said, “Forgive me; for I must have the holy chalice for to pass through the gate of the saint’s bones.”</p>
<p>Anon they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and gat the holy chalice, and ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and came to the gate; and Sir Trapoleoncus put the chalice in an alcove; and anon the gate opened without hands. And when they went through the gate, anon they beheld stairs. And they ascended; and at the top, they beheld stairs down. Thus they descended; and when they had so done, they beheld a stairway up; and when they ascended, behold, a stairway down. Thus they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and they came to a deep pit, wherein was a great cave; and there sat a man on a throne, and he was clothed all in white, with a crown of gold upon his head; and there were three lights like to the sun burning before him. And the man cried out, saying, “Wherefore hast thou robbed me? For I shall not give passage, save thou presenteth the garment.”</p>
<p>And Sir Trapoleoncus said, “Forgive me; for I must retrieve the surcoat for to pass over the pit.”</p>
<p>Anon they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and passed the gate; and anon they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and came to the abbey; and from the abbey Sir Trapoleoncus gat him a fine surcoat; and on the surcoat were sardius, topaz, carbuncle, emerald, sapphire, diamond, ligure, agate, amethyst, beryl, onyx, and jasper.</p>
<p>Anon they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and passed the gate; thereafter they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and came to the pit; and Sir Trapoleoncus gave the surcoat to the man; and anon a great bridge appeared over the pit, and it was made of marble, silver, and gold; and the pillars that bore the bridge were carved out of one piece of lapis, and every pillar was cut into four, and the pillars had rubies and carbuncles and topazes and amethysts and hyacinths and garnets and peridots and all manner other precious stones and jewels.</p>
<p>Then Sir Trapoleoncus led Sir Borsalhoof, Sir Lisettegeriuteamore, Sir Flavigiumludovicia, and Sir Cymrandon, and the abbot, and Saint Peter, across the pit. And when they had crossed the pit, anon they came to a grand stair. And so they ascended; and at the top, they beheld stairs down. Thus they descended; and when they had so done, they beheld a stairway up; and when they ascended, behold, a stairway down. Thus they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and they came to a great sea; and the water was very cold, and they were sore afraid. And when they came to the mouth of the sea, a ferry stood ready and moored, and a knight lay therein, and he said, “Cross ye the sea?”</p>
<p>“Aye,” said Sir Trapoleoncus.</p>
<p>“Then pay ye the toll, and I shall give ye passage.”</p>
<p>“We have no coin,” said Saint Peter.</p>
<p>“No force,” said Sir Trapoleoncus. “For in the abbey, I have a vessel for which to cross the sea.”</p>
<p>Anon they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and crossed the pit; thereafter they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and passed the gate; thereafter they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and came to the abbey; and Sir Trapoleoncus gat him a small boat.</p>
<p>Anon they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and passed the gate. Now they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and crossed the pit; anon they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and came to the sea. And when they had gone thither, they went on the vessel, and crossed the sea.</p>
<p>When they had done so, they came to a stairway; anon they ascended, and behold, a stairway; anon they descended, and beheld a fine stairway. Anon they ascended the stairs, and when they had so done, they beheld stairs down; and the stairs were fine marble and onyx, and gold silk and emerald ribbons flowed between the steps. Anon they descended the stairs.</p>
<p>Anon they beheld a grand mountain, and it was greater than any mountain in England, Scotland, or Wales; and none of the knights knew how they might cross it. Then spake the abbot, saying, “Sir Knights, go round about the mount, and see if ye may find some way to bring your horses over it.” When they saw the mountain, they would not do it; for Sir Borsalhoof said, “Our horses are tied without the abbey.”</p>
<p>Anon spake Sir Trapoleoncus, and said, “Knights, trouble yourselves not; for in the abbey there is a holy sceptre, and it is blessed by Saint Paul, and it will help us to get over the mountain, and we can cross it with the aid of the holy relic; wherefore, come and follow me to the abbey, and let us seek the sceptre of Saint Paul, and then ye shall have the faith and the strength of the Holy Ghost, and ye shall accomplish many marvels.”</p>
<p>Anon they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and crossed the sea. Now they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and crossed the pit; anon they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and went through the gate. And after they had ascended and descended, ascended and descended, they found in the abbey the holy sceptre.</p>
<p>Anon they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and crossed the gate; and afterward, they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and crossed the bridge; and after that, did they ascend and descend, and ascend and descend, and cross the sea. Thereafter they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and came to the mountain.</p>
<p>And Sir Borsalhoof, taking the sceptre in his hand, cried out, “By the grace of Our Lord, and with the blessing of Saint Paul, and by the power of the Holy Ghost, and truth, I charge thee, O mountain, to become like the plain, and the valley to open up the road, and cause the water and the grass to grow thereby.”</p>
<p>And all beheld a great marvel; for the mountain became a plain. For as it is written, an ye have faith, as a corn of mustard seed, ye shall say to this hill, Pass thou hence, and it shall pass; and nothing shall be impossible to you. And anon Sir Trapoleoncus led Sir Borsalhoof, Sir Lisettegeriuteamore, Sir Flavigiumludovicia, and Sir Cymrandon, and the abbot, and Saint Peter across the plain.</p>
<h3 id="how-sir-borsalhoof-brake-the-door-asunder">How Sir Borsalhoof Brake The Door Asunder</h3>
<p>And at the edge of the plain, it was as the very edge of the world; for there was a great stone wall stretching from the ground all the way to the heavens. And when the knights looked upon the wall, they all marvelled, and were astonished. For the stone was white and smooth, and there were trees all around it, and there was a little stream of bright water flowing out from the wall toward the sea.</p>
<p>Now Sir Borsalhoof said, “I will take a draught of water, and we shall drink together.”</p>
<p>And all drank of the water of the stream, and with their thirsts thus slaked, they were loath to depart. But all knew they must continue on to achieve the Holy Crumb.</p>
<p>And Sir Trapoleoncus led them all along the wall, and at last came they all to a door of marble carved in the wall; and the door had images of cherubim, and seraphim, and angels, and saints, and apostles, and martyrs; and it was fast closed. Then spake the abbot, “This is a door of great marvel; how shall we open it?”</p>
<p>And Sir Trapoleoncus said, “In truth, unless you had the key, it is likely no man should ever be able to enter here; but if any mortal sinner hath the strength, let him make the trial.”</p>
<p>And Sir Cymrandon went to the door, but he could not open it. And Sir Lisettegeriuteamore, and Sir Flavigiumludovicia, and even Sir Trapoleoncus with his mighty mouse legs, could not prevail.</p>
<p>Then Sir Borsalhoof said he would assay; and anon he came to the door, and with passing strength pulled it; and there was a sound as of thunder, and the rending of the earth, and the cries of a hundred armies; and with naught but his small hands and long arms did Sir Borsalhoof rend the door asunder. Then they saw within a vast marble chamber, and seated on winding stairs and platforms and terraces which stretched all the way to heaven, a multitude of monks sitting, and praying, and fasting, and weeping.</p>
<p>In the center of the chamber atop an altar sat a fair box of oak and cedar, and it had gold and silver and precious stones and pearls, and a cross of rich wood, and at the foot of the altar lay a crumb of bread like unto that Christ did eat.</p>
<p>And Sir Trapoleoncus went to the crumb, and ate of it.</p>
<p>Anon Sir Trapoleoncus spake, and said, “My heart is glad I have finally ate; for I was hungered. And now let us achieve the Holy Crumb.”</p>
<p>And Sir Trapoleoncus climbed on top of the box; and with all the power of his small body did he apert the box. And the knights, the abbot, and Saint Peter looked within; and behold, there sat upon a fine silken pillow an iron key.</p>
<p>“Herein lies the key that opens the door wherein the Holy Crumb is kept,” said Sir Trapoleoncus.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-crumb-knights-achieved-the-holy-crumb">How the Crumb Knights Achieved the Holy Crumb</h3>
<p>Thus the knights, and the abbot, and Saint Peter, took the key, and took leave of the marble chamber and the monks. Anon they crossed the plain, and ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and took their vessel, and crossed the sea. Thereafter, they ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and crossed the pit; and having crossed the pit, ascended and descended, ascended and descended, and passed through the gate; and having ascended and descended, ascended and descended, went within the abbey. And they went through the cloister, and the kitchen, and the refectory, and the dormitory, and the chapter house, and the scriptorium, and the library, and the lecture room, and the almonry, until they came into a dark place. And Sir Trapoleoncus lit a candle, and by the light of the candle, they found a small reliquary, and it had an iron lock.</p>
<p>“Holy Knights,” said Saint Peter, “your quest is at an end, and ye have achieved all ye would. And surely, great renown and worship will come to you, and Our Lord shall bless you, and ye shall do many great deeds, and your names shall never be forgotten, and ye shall serve Christendom. And when ye die ye shall surely have fellowship with me and with Our Lord. Now decide ye amongst yourselves who shall open the reliquary of the Holy Crumb.”</p>
<p>And Sir Borsalhoof came forward, and said, “Suffer me to take the Crumb; for though my hands are but the size of a finger, yet my strength is greater than any man’s, and my arm is stronger than any man. And as for holiness, I am a sinner; yet, being such, I shall certainly be saved by the grace of Our Lord.”</p>
<p>And the other knights said, “An you will undertake to open it, Sir Borsalhoof, we shall be well contented with you.”</p>
<p>Then Sir Cymrandon said he should open it, and all assented.</p>
<p>And Sir Borsalhoof opened the reliquary, and therein was the Holy Crumb.</p>
<p>After that the knights made a solemn oath to do good works, and they took counsel together, to do good unto one another, as men of prowess and honour, and to do great deeds of arms for Christendom, and also to tell men of the Gospel, and to love the poor and the needy, and to keep them from the devil.</p>
<p>Then the knights returned unto the court, and there they were magnificently received, and feasted, and honoured, and worshipped with songs, and there was a grand tournament. And Sir Borsalhoof overcame all of the knights of the tournament, and won great renown. And Sir Trapoleoncus also did great deeds of arms, and none had ever seen a mouse so keen with the lance, and the sword. And thus was Sir Trapoleoncus the most renowned knight of the Mouse Knights.</p>
<p>And at the tournament a messenger came to Sir Cymrandon, and said, “Sir Cymrandon, King Pelles has summoned you. For you are sworn to duel with Sir Mirtilus in a minstrel’s duel, as you promised one year ago.” And Sir Cymrandon with all speed gat Bertram, and smote the silver bell, and returned again to the castle wherein he was to duel.</p>
<p>And the Holy Crumb was carried to the abbot’s cell, and put in a vault. Then Sir Borsalhoof went away and lived with his brothers, and they all lived together in joy, till death. And Sir Lisettegeriuteamore went to live in Ireland, and lived long, and died there. And Sir Flavigiumludovicia put away from him helm and hauberk, and became a monk, and served God many years.</p>
<p>And so the Holy Crumb was again achieved; and many knights after would also seek the Crumb. And today hath the Holy Crumb been lost. But mayhap there be some worthy knights in England, France, or in other divers places, that may seek it and find it, if God be willing.</p>
<p>And also Lady Rosamonde and Lady Cariad came together; and they went to mass, and received the Host, and by prayer was the evil enchantment of the wizard undone.</p>
<p>“Beloved Cariad,” said Rosamonde, “we have assayed the faith of our husbands. What say you?”</p>
<p>And Lady Cariad spake, saying, “It may be there are two knights in England faithful to their wives, and they be damned fools.”</p>
